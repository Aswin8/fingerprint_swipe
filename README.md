  <strong>Fingerprint Swipe (left,right,up for Back, Home, Recents/Sleep)

The third party custom fingerprint apps were not working after Pie update, which was so useful since this is a huge phone, so made a custom module inspired by rori's module.

What it does?
Swipe left for BACK/Close notification
Swipe right for HOME
Swipe up for RECENTS
Swipe up twice for switching to LAST APP
Swipe down UNTOUCHED (Default notifications swipe)

### Usage
- Install Module through Magisk and Reboot. You are good to go.
- Tested on OP5T PIE Open Beta 20 to 28/stable 9.x Magisk v17.3/ v18/v19

*Uninstall/disable module before system update and reinstall / enable after updating system.

Works in most Custom ROMs like Pixel experience, test and report.


( Edit : Not working in OP6, it reportedly uses a different FP sensor and it do not recognise swipe at all
Edit 2: OP5T only)

If anyone need any specific custom actions I can make in free time.
